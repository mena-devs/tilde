## Prerequisites

This project requires:

* Ruby 2.4.1, preferably managed using [rbenv][]
* PhantomJS (in order to use the [poltergeist][] gem)
* PostgreSQL must be installed and accepting connections
* [Redis][] must be installed and running on localhost with the default port

On a Mac, you can obtain all of the above packages using [Homebrew][].
