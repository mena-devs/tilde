Hello <%= @invitation.invitee_name %>,

MENAdevs was first launched in January,
  2015 with the purpose of connecting Software Developers,
   Designers and Computer Enthusiasts in the MENA region.
    What started as a Slack group has evolved to become a vibrant community of
    200+ members engaging in daily discussions in software, and web development,
    tools of the trade, work methodologies and workflows,
    and technical management styles (to name a few of the popular topics).

We are looking forward to your active contributions to the community while
  appreciating you following our basic guidelines and Code of Conduct (CoC)
  [https://github.com/mena-devs/code-of-conduct]:
  Respect other members of the group and let this CoC guide your actions.
  Do not insult and engage in degrading behaviours towards any member as these
  actions will not be tolerated.

We encourage freedom of speech and we will try to avoid content censoring,
however, apply the utmost consideration for the content discussed or shared by
 flagging NSFW material, avoiding profanities, and avoiding malicious commentary.

Avoid spamming at all cost and / or the abuse of private details of members.
Examples of information abuse are, but not limited to: Sharing members'
contact information with any 3rd party, Use members' details for sales /
promotional purposes, Sharing the content of private discussions on external platforms, etc.

As a result of breaking any of the rules above, a ban will immediately be
  applied by an admin after internal deliberation and the delivery of a
  formal and final warning. The ban is permanent and is not up for debate.

Finally, admittance to the group will always remain invitation only.
  If you wish to invite other people, you can reach out with a private message
  to one of the 6 active admins (Ayman, Layale, Omar, Bassem, Joe and Constantine)
   with contact details of the invitee (Full name, and Email address).
   The inviting party (you) should know the invitee in person and introduce them
  on Slack (under the #introductions channel) once they
   accept the invitation and join the group.

On behalf of the MENAdevs admins,
Welcome on board and enjoy your stay!
